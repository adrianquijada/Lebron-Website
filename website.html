        <h3 class="header"> 1. Bronny is in the NBA</h3>
        <p class = "text"> Statistically speaking, nobody in history has ever had their son be present in the NBA the same time they have, which speaks volumes to his longevity and consitstency as a player. While he might retire soon, it's not because his performance is declining; it's because he's getting tired of the game.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3 class="header">2. He appeared in the finals every year for the past decade</h3>
        <p class = "text"> It's not just his pure consistency that makes him good, it's the level that he's been playing at all these years. Anybody can be consistently bad, but the way Lebron is playing makes this an exception. Even since I was born, I've always heard of the name "Lebron James". His infamousy, drive, and dominance is an era characterized by his name alone.

    <div>
        <h3 class="header">3. He carries the record for the most points of all time </h3>
        <p class = "text"> Notoriously in 2023, he became the NBA's All-Time Leading Scorer. Despite the Lakers losing that game 133-130, the night belonged to LeBron. The achievement further solidified his legacy as one of the greatest players of all time, complementing his four NBA championships, four MVP awards, and 19 All-Star selections. Even at age 38, he showed no signs of slowing down, proving his dominance in his 20th NBA season. With every additional point scored, he extended a record that may stand for decades to come.

        <h3 class="header">4. He has more raw stats than Michael Jordan</h3>
        <p class = "text">Look up the stats. He's more versatile than Michael Jordan, which is why MJ has only been on two teams in his career.

        <h3 class="header">5. 2018</h3>
    <p class = "text">2018 Lebron James was the most impressive level of the game we've seen anybody play. Ever. Imagine absolutely carrying a team who would've been absolutely nobody without you, facilitating the offense and defense through your presence on the field.
